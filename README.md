OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project: WEATHER FORECAST APP

OBJECTIVE

This weather forecast app aims to provide users with up-to-date weather information. Users can enter the name of a city to get weather details, which are dynamically displayed in the app. The design features a simple and intuitive interface for ease of use. It integrates with external libraries for enhanced functionality and styling.

KEY ACTIVITES

1) City Name Input: Users can enter the name of a city in the input box to request weather information.
2) Weather Data Retrieval: The app fetches real-time weather data from an external API based on the user's input.
3) Dynamic Display: The retrieved weather information is dynamically appended to the weather-body section using JavaScript.
4) Error Handling and Notifications: The app uses SweetAlert to display error messages or notifications for invalid city names or other issues.
